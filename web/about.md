This site reviews a broad selection of Visual Programming Language ideas and
projects and discusses this persistent paradigm that straddles
both programming language design and visual design disciplines and emerges from
both practical and academic work in each. As a result of this multidiscipline
identity, it seems reasonable to expect project success to rely on effective
design choices across these two often disparate technical and creative domains.

Anecdotally, it seems that the success of these projects is patchy at best, when
evaluated using a common goal of broad adoption. Indeed even academic research
projects which aim to answer questions rather than make useful tools that become
popular tend to acknowledge in their founding statements that something critical
is lacking in most existing implementations.

Nevertheless, the idea of visual programming languages is persistent and often
given as a self-evident imperative, usually based on a summary assessment of 
human psychology in the domain of thinking, planning and decision-making:
"Some people are just visual".

This survey seeks to prompt conclusions about the reasons and contributing
factors both for common project failures and exemplary successes in VPLs
in order to support informed decision-making in any such future projects.
